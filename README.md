# SynthWave '84 - Midnight Commander

![Synthwave '84 logo over a cityscape](media/banner.png)

A skin for Midnight Commander that is compatible with the
[SynthWave '84 kitty theme](https://github.com/spmarsden/synthwave-kitty), based
on the [SynthWave '84](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode) colour
scheme.

## Installation

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/mc/skins
cd ~/.local/share/mc/
git clone git@github.com:spmarsden/synthwave-mc.git
cd skins
ln -s ../synthwave-mc/themes/* ./
```

The skin can now be selected under Options > Appearance > synthwave84.

## Thanks

Many thanks to [Rob Owen](https://github.com/robb0wen) for the original theme,
(and from whom I stole the banner from), and to
